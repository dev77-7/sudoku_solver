# sudoku_solver
A basic sudoku solver program using backtracking algorithm.

The code is wriiten in Python using Sublime text editor (-v 3).

The Program Uses "board" as board grid and the patterns or sudoku board can be changed(for easy demo some extra grid patterns are present in Grid Pattern.txt file).

Time Complexity: O(n ^ m) where n is the number of possibilities for each square (i.e., 9 in classic Sudoku) and m is the number of spaces that are blank.

Space Complexity: O(n*n): To store the output array a matrix is needed.
